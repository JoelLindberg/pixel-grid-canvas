Automatic code testing (unit tests? not sure what it's called)
Have fun!


## Progress

### Version 0.0.1 (making it work)
[X] Basic functionality
[X] Click and hold drawing
[X] Set canvas size
[X] Set resolution
[X] Color selection

### Version 0.0.2 (design and advanced tools)
[X] Re-make grid because the current solution is not scalable or future proof. Also not easy to understand.
[] Advanced color selection (color to the left and brightness/saturation to the right).
[] Tool buttons (pen, eraser, fill, clear,).
[] Toggle grid button (tool?).
[] Make it pretty! Put time into design.

### Version 0.0.3 (safety for moving forward)
[] Refactor code and make it more readable and re-usable.
[] Add tests.

### Version 0.0.4 (more tools and functions)
[] Mirroring for pattern making.
[] Save to file as png with alpha.
