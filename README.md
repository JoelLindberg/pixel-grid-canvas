# Pixel Grid Canvas
A personal learning project.<br/>
<br/>

Goals:
* Javscript
* HTML
* CSS
* Markdown
* Github
* Automatic code testing. Unit tests? (not sure what it's called yet)
* To have fun! :)

## Progress - Road to version 1.0

### Version 0.1.0 (making the basic it work)
 - [x] Basic functionality 
 - [x] Click and hold drawing
 - [x] Set canvas size
 - [x] Set resolution
 - [x] Color selection

### Version 0.2.0 (design and tools)
- [x] Re-make grid because the current solution is not scalable or future proof. Also not easy to understand.
- [] Advanced color selection (color to the left and brightness/saturation to the right).
- [] Tool buttons: Pen, Eraser, Fill, Clear, Grid (toggle).
- [] Make it pretty! Put time into design.

### Version 0.3.0 (structure and safety before moving forward)
- [] Refactor code and make it more readable and re-usable.
- [] Block out the "Usage" guide to force myself to think through the structure while refactoring.
- [] Add tests.

### Version 0.4.0 (add more tools)
- [] Mirroring for pattern making.
- [] Save to file as png with alpha.
